    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>The Department of Political Science offers BA( Honours) and BA( Programme ) courses. It was one of the earliest Honours Departments (having been started in 1978) in this college, as also one of the earliest to offer a Honours course in Poitical Science amongst the constituent Evening colleges of the University of Delhi . We have recently sought approval from the University of Delhi for starting the Post - Graduate course of MA (Political Science) in our College, which is awaited.
    The students that we attract come from a wide variety of backgrounds and have a national character. 88% of our students come from outside of the NCT of Delhi. We are a big draw for students coming from various states of India apart from the North East. ( The cut off percentage for intake of students for our Honours course in the last Admission list in 2016 was a healthy 85% in the aggregate ). We have a very lively student community who are encouraged in immersing in extra curricular activities . The Political Science Society ( Samprabhu) is the cultural wing which organises seminars, Talks apart from intra and inter collegiate level debates , quiz , elocution contest the year around. Students have started a periodical Wall Newmagazine . They also have a presence in the cyberspace by running an informal blog called 'Political Science Society of PGDAVE College' on Facebook as a medium for exchange of views and information. Our students have participated at the University level and done well. Recently our students won a University level competition and were rewarded by being included in the University of Delhi's Gyanodaya Project under which they were sent on an educational tour to the North Eastern states.
